1. I created proxy HTTP web server(framework GIN) for 3rd-party service.
2. As service i wrote simple micro-service to search data from internet(i used serp-api)
3. For protocol i used gRPC. I created service.proto file inside directory "./proto".

For run this -proxy server:
  1. Start gRPC server: go run server/server.go
  2. Start proxy server: go run client/client.go
For testing send json GET request by POSTMAN:
  `
  {
	"method":"GET",
	"url": "nothing",
	"data": "car"
  }
  `
